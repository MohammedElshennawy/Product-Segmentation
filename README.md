This project explores advanced segmentation of e-commerce customers based on their aggregated product purchases, with the goal of improving personalization, marketing effectiveness, and customer engagement.

While traditional analyses often rely on demographic or basic transactional summaries, this initiative adopts a behavior-first approach‚Äîwhere segmentation is derived from what customers actually buy, not just who they are.

To accommodate the complexity of customer behaviors and product diversity (over 13,000 products across 26 categories), we focus on reducing dimensionality and capturing latent shopping patterns. This is achieved by constructing multiple purchase matrices (e.g., Customer √ó Category, segmented by gender), and applying various unsupervised learning techniques to uncover meaningful clusters.

> **Note**: At this stage, we have not yet committed to a final clustering algorithm. Instead, we evaluate multiple paths (e.g., dimensionality reduction + clustering, direct matrix factorization) to determine the most suitable approach based on data sparsity, interpretability, and business alignment.

## üéØ The core objectives of this project are:

### 1. Develop a Behavior-Based Segmentation Approach
- Construct customer √ó category purchase matrices (including merged and gender-specific versions).
- Address data sparsity using appropriate preprocessing (e.g., robust scaling and zero-preservation).

### 2. Evaluate Suitable Segmentation Techniques
- Explore different segmentation paths:
  - Direct clustering (e.g., K-Means)
  - Matrix factorization (e.g., NMF) to uncover latent purchasing behaviors
- Compare methods using silhouette scores, reconstruction errors, and interpretability.

### 3. Interpret and Label Segments
- Identify top product categories for each segment.
- Analyze demographic traits (age, gender, region) to contextualize each group.
- Assign meaningful labels to support downstream applications (e.g., ‚ÄúComfort-Focused Shoppers‚Äù, ‚ÄúSeasonal Buyers‚Äù).

### 4. Support Marketing and Product Strategy
- Translate segments into actionable business insights:
  - Personalized promotions
  - Gender-specific bundling strategies
  - Regional campaign targeting

These objectives ensure that the segmentation framework is both statistically valid and directly aligned with business goals, paving the way for smarter recommendations and more relevant customer engagement.
